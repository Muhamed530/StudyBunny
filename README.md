# StudyBunny
Study webapp to help students with studying for assignments, tests, and projects for different classes. This webapp will give students different ways to study, depending on the study method that matches for them. It will get inputs of different notes, lectures, videos that the students have and import it into either better notes, or another learning method that will help them. This project was created during Golden Hack at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. It won the prototype non-functional category.
